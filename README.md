## ✨ Overview

**NeuroRest** is a machine learning project that predicts **sleep quality** and **stress levels** based on lifestyle factors like:

* 💤 Sleep Hours
* 🚶 Physical Activity
* 📱 Screen Time
* 👣 Steps
* 👤 Age, Gender, Occupation

The project leverages data-driven insights to help individuals **improve their well-being** by identifying patterns in daily habits.

---

## 🎯 Features

✅ Predict **sleep quality** (good, average, poor)
✅ Predict **stress levels** (low, medium, high)
✅ Clean & beginner-friendly codebase
✅ Interactive visualizations for insights
✅ Ready for deployment on Streamlit / Flask

## 📊 Dataset  

This project uses two Kaggle datasets that provide information on **sleep quality** and **stress factors**:  

1. **Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset**  
   - File: `Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv`  
   - Source: [Kaggle - Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset)  
   - Contains information about individuals' **sleep patterns and lifestyle habits**.  
   - **Key Features:**  
     - Age, Gender, Occupation  
     - Sleep Duration (hours)  
     - Quality of Sleep (scale 1–10)  
     - Physical Activity Level  
     - Stress Level (scale 1–10)  
     - BMI Category, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Daily Steps  

2. **Student Stress Factors Dataset**  
   - File: `Student Stress Factors.csv`  
   - Source: [Kaggle - Student Stress Factors](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samyakb/student-stress-factors)  
   - Focuses on **stress levels among students** based on academic, lifestyle, and social factors.  
   - **Key Features:**  
     - Sleep Duration, Screen Time  
     - Academic Pressure, Study Hours  
     - Diet Quality, Physical Activity  
     - Stress Levels (categorized)  

🔗 These datasets are analyzed together to build the **NeuroRest: Stress and Sleep Predictor**, highlighting how **lifestyle, academic, and health factors influence stress and sleep quality**.
